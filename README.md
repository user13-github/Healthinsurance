This project provides a streamlit web application for predicting multiple diseases, including blood Pressuer, Depression, heartattack, Choronic disorders, Overall Health using machine learning algorithms. The prediction models are deployed using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications.


The Multiple Disease Prediction project aims to create a  web application that allows Insurance firms to input relevant medical information and receive predictions for different diseases for the clients so that company can leverge the this data and invest wisely. The machine learning models trained on Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System datasets cerated by the help of CDC, USA. which enable accurate predictions for various diseases before hand

Features
The Multiple Disease Prediction web application offers the following features:

User Input: Clients can input medical information, including age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant factors.
Disease Prediction: The application utilizes machine learning models to predict the likelihood of having  blood Pressuer, Depression, heartattack, Choronic disorders, Overall Health and various other disorders based on the inputted medical data.
Prediction Results: The predicted disease outcomes are displayed to the user, providing an indication of the probability of each disease.
Visualization: Visualizations are generated to highlight important features and provide insights into the prediction process.
User-Friendly Interface: The web application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for individuals without technical knowledge to use the prediction tool.
